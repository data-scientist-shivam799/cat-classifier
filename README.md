# cat-classifier
A cat classifier neural network is a type of machine learning model designed to identify whether the input image is cat or not..

It uses a deep learning algorithm to analyze features in images, such as the shape and texture of the cat's fur, ears, and eyes. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled cat images to learn to recognize the patterns and characteristics that distinguish cats from other animals or objects. Once trained, the cat classifier can accurately classify new images of cats with high accuracy. It can be used for a variety of applications, such as sorting and organizing images of cats, or identifying cats in videos or live streams.
